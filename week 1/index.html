                                <p>I currently use two workstations to get my work done.  One is a Windows workstation that has an Intel i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, 3 displays, and an AMD Radeon HD 7870 running Windows 7.  The other is an older MacBook Pro Late 2008 edition with 4 GB of RAM running Mac OS X 10.7.  I typically switch workstations when I'm on the move and synchronize my files using a personal DropBox.</p>

                                <p>On my Windows workstation, I like to code in Notepad++.  It's a great app that has color coding for several languages.  Alternatively, I use an application called Coda on my Mac workstation for the same reasons.  Coda also has a built in FTP function that allows you to upload and download files to and from your remote server.  I tend to stay away from WYSIWYG editors because it's simply easier to check outcomes in a regular browser window.</p>

                            <p>I begin where anyone must begin after they've planned to start a web development project; I write some code.  After I feel I've put my ideas into code, I save, commit, and upload my work to a remote server, or check files on my workstation.</p>
                            <p>Next I see the results of my effort by opening pages in different browsers.  If I'm working with JavaScript, I'll debug any errors using the built-in console.</p>
                            <p>After recognizing the bugs, I'll go back to my code and correct or re-write what I have.  If necessary, I'll tweak the design or make adjustments to the layout based on what I want to actually see.  Finally, I repeat until I have my finished product!</p>
